            <h2>Securing Systems, Solving Cases, and Exposing Scams.</h2>
            <p>My journey in cybersecurity goes beyond theory—I’ve tackled real-world challenges head-on. From wireless security testing in live environments to leveraging OSINT skills to assist in solving a missing person case, I believe in using knowledge for impact.

                One of my most significant achievements was investigating a financial scam on a trading platform, where a hidden bug led to massive monetary losses. My findings not only uncovered the exploit but also helped prevent further victims from falling into the same trap. Additionally, I’ve worked on malware analysis and device security, ensuring systems stay resilient against threats.
                
                For me, cybersecurity isn’t just about defense—it’s about proactive problem-solving and real-world impact.</p>
